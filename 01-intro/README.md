# Redux Intro 

What is Redux and why should you care?

## Single Page Applications 

In mulitpage applications application state is stored on the server and data
is sent to the browser with each refresh. 

SPAs (or Single Page Applications) are applications that run in the browser. 
Usually written in JavaScript. They act as a full featured multi-screen 
application while not actually refreshing the browser.

## Application State 

Application state is data that represents the content and 
information presented via the UI. Often the same data is displayed in 
different ways. Pieces of data might appear in different ways at different
locations on the same screen. It may also appear in different ways in 
different screens.

Discuss with a partner application state. Use examples from projects you 
have built. Also, consider published applications that you use every day. 
Consider important pieces of state, it's type, and how it is updated.
